The LLM-powered Beer Distribution Game shares much with the classic 
version --- but with a twist:  instead of human players, this game is 
played among Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous decision makers. 
Each LLM (currently powered by GPT-4o-mini) controls one component of the 
supply chain --- retailer, wholesaler, distributor, or factory. Identical 
to the setup of the traditional Beer Game, each role manages the inventory 
at that facility, responds to downstream orders, and decides how many 
units to order upstream (or produce, in the case of the factory) to 
minimize costs.
This is the first online simulator to experiment with LLM deployment in 
supply chain management. It offers features that enable you to explore a 
variety of simple and advanced supply chain management concepts. Most 
importantly, you will witness with immediate feedback the outcome of LLMsâ€™ 
decision-making across a variety of supply chain scenarios you control.
Since you are here, you have everything you need to operate the game. No 
additional setup is required.
