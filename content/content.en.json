This supply chain simulation challenges players to minimize total costs while managing inventory and avoiding stockouts across four interconnected roles. The game demonstrates how information delays and limited visibility create the famous \"Bullwhip Effect\" - where small changes in customer demand amplify into wild swings upstream. <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/SDG/T-00-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about its origins at MIT</a>.",
