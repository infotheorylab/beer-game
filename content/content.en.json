      "body": "The <span class=\"highlight-text\">Beer Distribution Game</span> was developed at MIT in the 1960s and has been played by MBA and Executive students for over 60 years. The goal is simple: minimize supply chain costs. Four players take different roles (retailer, wholesaler, distributor, and factory) in a beer distribution network.<br><br>The game works in rounds, each representing one week. Each player makes just ONE decision per round: how much to order from their supplier (or how much to produce as the factory). Despite this simple decision, two things make the game challenging:<br><br><strong>1. Limited Information:</strong> If you're not the retailer, you don't see what customers actually want.<br><strong>2. Delivery Delays:</strong> Orders take time to arrive from suppliers.<br><br>Players must track both their on-hand inventory and their pipeline inventory (what they ordered but hasn't arrived yet). These complications create the famous <span class=\"highlight-text\">Bullwhip Effect</span> - small changes in customer demand create wild swings in orders upstream in the supply chain.",

      "body": "The LLM-powered Beer Distribution Game shares much with the classic version --- but with a twist: instead of human players, this game is played among Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous decision makers. Each LLM (currently powered by GPT-4o-mini) controls one component of the supply chain --- retailer, wholesaler, distributor, or factory. Identical to the setup of the traditional Beer Game, each role manages the inventory at that facility, responds to downstream orders, and decides how many units to order upstream (or produce, in the case of the factory) to minimize costs.<br><br>This is the first online simulator to experiment with LLM deployment in supply chain management. It offers features that enable you to explore a variety of simple and advanced supply chain management concepts. Most importantly, you will witness with immediate feedback the outcome of LLMs' decision-making across a variety of supply chain scenarios you control.<br><br>Since you are here, you have everything you need to operate the game. No additional setup is required."
